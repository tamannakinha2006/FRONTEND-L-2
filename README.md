🤔 Why AEGIS Exists
	
Traditional AI	Give the AI access to money and hope it behaves.
AEGIS	Give every task its own Mission Wallet with built-in rules.
Result	Even if the AI is compromised, the treasury isn't.

💡 Why It Matters
Traditional finance dashboards show what happened. AEGIS shows why, how, and whether it should have happened. That's the difference between a ledger and a governance system.

Every AI Needs a Mission. Every Mission Needs a Wallet. 🛡️
